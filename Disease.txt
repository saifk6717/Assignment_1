This article aims to implement a robust machine-learning model that can 
efficiently predict the disease of a human, based on the symptoms that he/she possesses. 
Let us look into how we can approach this machine-learning problem:

Approach:

Gathering the Data: Data preparation is the primary step for any 
machine learning problem. We will be using a dataset from Kaggle
 for this problem. This dataset consists of two CSV files one for 
training and one for testing. There is a total of 133 columns in the 
dataset out of which 132 columns represent the symptoms and 
the last column is the prognosis.
Cleaning the Data: Cleaning is the most important step in a 
machine learning project. The quality of our data determines the 
quality of our machine-learning model. So it is always necessary 
to clean the data before feeding it to the model for training. In our 
dataset all the columns are numerical, the target column i.e. 
prognosis is a string type and is encoded to numerical form using a label encoder.
Model Building: After gathering and cleaning the data, the 
data is ready and can be used to train a machine learning model. 
We will be using this cleaned data to train the Support Vector 
Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. 
We will be using a confusion matrix to determine the quality of the models.
Inference: After training the three models we will be predicting the disease 
for the input symptoms by combining the predictions of all three models. 
This makes our overall prediction more robust and accurate.
At last, we will be defining a function that takes symptoms 
separated by commas as input, predicts the disease based on the symptoms 
by using the trained models, and returns the predictions in a JSON format.
