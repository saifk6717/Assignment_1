Reading the dataset
Firstly we will be loading the dataset from the folders 
using the pandas library. While reading the dataset we 
will be dropping the null column. This dataset is a clean 
dataset with no null values and all the features consist of
 0â€™s and 1s. Whenever we are solving a classification task 
it is necessary to check whether our target column is balanced 
or not. We will be using a bar plot, to check whether the 
dataset is balanced or not.
